# mini_lua
The Java source code of an interpreter for a subset of the LUA Programming Language. 
This project was made as a College Assignment.

It's composed by a lexical analysis, which will verify the accurate formation of the language tokens; a sysntatic analysis, that will confirm that the token combinations follow the grammar rules; and the interpreter itself, responsible for executing each command or assignment of a given script.
